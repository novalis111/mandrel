/**
 * TC015: Code Complexity MCP API Handlers
 * 
 * Comprehensive API endpoints for accessing code complexity intelligence:
 * - Multi-dimensional complexity analysis (cyclomatic, cognitive, Halstead, coupling)
 * - Real-time complexity monitoring and alerting
 * - Complexity trend analysis and forecasting
 * - Refactoring opportunity identification
 * - Technical debt quantification and tracking
 * - Complexity hotspot detection and management
 * 
 * Performance Target: Sub-100ms API response times for dashboard queries
 * Integration: Git tracking, pattern detection, development metrics
